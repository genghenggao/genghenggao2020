### 4、Quotations&Comments

-  The Earth and its systems are complex and interconnected and gaining a comprehensive understanding of these systems and how we interact with them is of critical national and international interest ([Boyd and Crawford, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425717301086?via%3Dihub#bb0030), [Frankel and Reid, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425717301086?via%3Dihub#bb0090), [Hart and Saunders, 1997](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425717301086?via%3Dihub#bb0115), [Lynch, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425717301086?via%3Dihub#bb0200)). 
-  The Oxford Dictionary defines ‘Big Data’ as “Datasets that are too large and complex to manipulate or interrogate with standard methods or tools”. The term was first described by [Laney (2001)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425717301086?via%3Dihub#bb0165) as “the three V's: Volume, Velocity and Variety”. Others have extended this list to include validity, veracity, value, and visibility.

### 4、Quotations&Comments

- The pivotal issue that needs to be addressed is the identification of a method to effectively combine geoscience algorithms in a distributed environment to promote cooperation. 需要解决的关键问题是确定一种在分布式环境中有效组合地球科学算法以促进合作的方法。

- Many researchers utilize distributed computing technology to solve these challenges and they have achieved positive results [[1](https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/8/1/12/htm#B1-ijgi-08-00012),[2](https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/8/1/12/htm#B2-ijgi-08-00012),[3](https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/8/1/12/htm#B3-ijgi-08-00012)].  

- In the study, a management mechanism for geoscience algorithms is designed and implemented, which facilitates the registration of, search for, and invocation of the distributed geoscience algorithms.   Geoscience algorithm integration is implemented using an XML-based script. 

- As early as 1983, Blanning proposed the problem of managing various types of geoscience models and algorithms in the form of a document and proposed the concept of the model library, which managed models and algorithms with a defined model library query language (MQL) [[4](https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/8/1/12/htm#B4-ijgi-08-00012)]. 

- Driven by network technology, web service platforms have become a new solution for the integration of network applications. Web service technologies have been widely used to construct distributed, modular applications and service-oriented applications. 

- Service-oriented applications have become the direction of new geoscience developments. Geospatial application activities are moving from a professional field to a networked, socialized, and popular service that is being accepted by various domain experts and even nonprofessionals [[7](https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/8/1/12/htm#B7-ijgi-08-00012)].  

- The emergence of common web services also enables geospatial data sharing and algorithm interoperability, and, when compared with other distributed architectures, the geoscience algorithm sharing based on a common service-oriented architecture (SOA) has obvious advantages. 

- To meet the requirements of distributed geoscience data and algorithm sharing, the International Organization for Standardization/Technical Committee (ISO/TC 211) and the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) formulated a series of geographical data services and processing service standards, including a Web Map Service (**WMS**), Web Feature Service (**WFS**), Web Coverage Service (**WCS**), and Web Processing Service (**WPS**), to standardize data transmission and processing interfaces.

-  Experiment
  
  - Four server host virtual machines (VMs) are launched in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong, as shown in [Figure 7](https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/8/1/12/htm#fig_body_display_ijgi-08-00012-f007)a. Each VM is equipped with four virtual CPUs of 2.2 GHz, 8-GB RAM, and a 20 Mb/s network.   To test the feasibility and performance of the proposed method around the world, the test environment is also built on Alibaba Cloud, which is a cloud service that is available around the world. Four server host VMs are launched in London (UK), Silicon Valley (USA), Beijing (CHN), and Sydney (AUS), as shown in [Figure 7](https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/8/1/12/htm#fig_body_display_ijgi-08-00012-f007)b. Each VM is equipped with four virtual CPUs of 2.5 GHz, 8-GB RAM, and 40G ROM.

### 4、Quotations&Comments

- Meanwhile, various parallel computing paradigms have been developed to manipulate massive spatiotemporal data from the traditional Cluster and Grid Computing, to Cloud Computing and heterogeneous CPU/GPU Computing (Schadt *et al*. [2010](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13658816.2019.1605073#), Li *et al*. [2013a](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13658816.2019.1605073#), Huang *et al*. [2013b](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13658816.2019.1605073#), Yang *et al*. [2017](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13658816.2019.1605073#), Hu *et al*. [2018a](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13658816.2019.1605073#)).  

- While these online systems can integrate and analyze distributed geospatial data, most of them only support fixed user interface with predefined functions. 

- high performance computing using MapReduce parallel computing framework (Li *et al*. [2016](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13658816.2019.1605073#)), 

- SOVAS adopts a layer-based architecture that seamlessly synthesizes big spatiotemporal data management, parallel computing, spatiotemporal query analytics, visualization, and spatial web portal in a unified environment ([Figure 1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13658816.2019.1605073#F0001)).

### 5、Methods

- The web portal is developed with Javascript and HTML by utilizing a set of third-party libraries, including jQuery, Bootstrap for interface, as well as D3.js, Google Chart API, Google Maps APIs, and Web WorldWind for visualizations. 

- More computer nodes can be added without the need of modifying the system. We observed that most queries were finished within several minutes when analyzing the two terabytes of climate data using our 13-node cluster.
